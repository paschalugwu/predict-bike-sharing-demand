# Predicting Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon

**Introduction**

### Project Overview

In the growing realm of urban mobility, bike-sharing systems play a crucial role in providing sustainable transportation options. Accurately predicting bike demand is vital for optimizing bike distribution and availability, reducing operational costs, and enhancing user satisfaction. This project leverages AutoGluon, a cutting-edge automated machine learning tool, to predict bike-sharing demand. The primary objective is to develop a model that predicts the number of bikes needed at various times and locations, ensuring efficient bike allocation and meeting user needs effectively.

### Personal Motivation

My journey as an aspiring data scientist and engineer has been fueled by a passion for solving real-world problems through innovative technology. The increasing popularity of bike-sharing systems and their potential to mitigate urban transportation challenges inspired me to undertake this project. The idea of using data to enhance operational efficiency and promote eco-friendly transportation aligns with my career aspirations in data science and machine learning. This project not only showcases my technical skills but also reflects my commitment to making a positive impact through data-driven solutions.

**Methodology**

### Data Collection and Preparation

The dataset for this project was sourced from a Kaggle competition on bike-sharing demand. It includes historical data on bike rentals, featuring various attributes such as datetime, weather conditions, and count of rentals. The data collection process involved downloading the dataset via the Kaggle API and unzipping the files for exploration. 

**Challenges Faced:**
- **Handling Missing Values:** Ensured the dataset was complete by verifying that all entries were available for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created additional features such as 'hour' extracted from the datetime column to capture time-specific patterns in bike demand.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA provided valuable insights into the dataset:
- **Visualization:** Histograms and scatter plots revealed the distribution and relationships between features like temperature, humidity, and bike count.
- **Patterns:** A clear trend was observed where bike demand peaks during certain hours of the day, particularly morning and evening rush hours.
- **Anomalies:** Notable deviations in bike usage were linked to weather conditions, such as significant drops during heavy rainfall.

**Modeling and Implementation**

### Model Selection

AutoGluon's TabularPredictor was chosen for its ease of use and robust performance in automating the machine learning pipeline. Several models were considered, including linear regression and decision trees, but AutoGluon’s ensemble approach proved superior in handling complex patterns in the data.

**Rationale:** AutoGluon’s automatic selection and tuning of models, combined with its ability to handle a diverse range of input features, made it the ideal choice for this project.

### Implementation Details

The model was implemented using AutoGluon’s Tabular Prediction feature:
- **Libraries Used:** AutoGluon, pandas, matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Training Process:** The model was trained with the goal of minimizing root mean squared error (RMSE), focusing on achieving high-quality predictions.
- **Code Snippets:**
    ```python
    from autogluon.tabular import TabularPredictor

    # Training the model
    predictor = TabularPredictor(label='count', eval_metric='root_mean_squared_error').fit(train_data=train, time_limit=600, presets='best_quality')
    ```

**Results and Evaluation**

### Model Performance

The model’s performance was evaluated using RMSE:
- **Initial Model:** Achieved an RMSE of 1.83892, indicating room for improvement.
- **With Additional Features:** Introducing the 'hour' feature reduced the RMSE to 0.62523.
- **With Hyperparameter Optimization:** Further tuning and optimization yielded a final RMSE of 0.514, significantly enhancing the model's accuracy.

### Business Impact

The predictive model offers substantial benefits:
- **Optimized Bike Distribution:** Accurate predictions allow for better allocation of bikes, reducing shortages and surpluses.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Enhances scheduling and maintenance planning, leading to cost savings.
- **User Satisfaction:** Ensures bike availability aligns with user demand, improving the overall user experience.

**Challenges and Solutions**

### Obstacles Encountered

**Major Challenges:**
- **Data Discrepancies:** Handling missing and inconsistent data entries required meticulous preprocessing.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identifying and creating relevant features demanded careful analysis of the dataset.

**Solutions Implemented:**
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values and standardized data formats.
- **Feature Creation:** Generated new features like 'hour' to capture time-based patterns.

**Conclusion and Future Work**

### Project Summary

This project successfully developed a predictive model for bike-sharing demand using AutoGluon, achieving significant improvements in accuracy through feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization. The model’s ability to forecast bike demand has practical implications for enhancing the efficiency and user satisfaction of bike-sharing systems.

### Future Improvements

**Potential Enhancements:**
- **Incorporate More Features:** Including additional weather variables or user demographics could further improve predictions.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Implementing a real-time prediction system to dynamically adjust to changing demand patterns.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Analyzing location-based data to optimize bike station placements and routes.
